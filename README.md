# CPP_HASHTABLE
The project involves implementing a C++ hash table that stores string data indexed by integer keys, using open addressing for collision resolution. It includes creating classes to manage the hash table, perform insertions, deletions, and searches, and evaluate performance based on the chosen collision strategy.
